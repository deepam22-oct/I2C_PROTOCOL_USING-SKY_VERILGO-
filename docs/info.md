# I2C Protocol Project Documentation

## How it works

This project implements an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol for [describe your specific application - e.g., sensor interfacing, device control, data acquisition, etc.].

### I2C Protocol Overview
- **Communication Type**: Synchronous, serial communication
- **Topology**: Multi-master, multi-slave bus architecture
- **Signal Lines**: 
  - SDA (Serial Data Line) - bidirectional data transfer
  - SCL (Serial Clock Line) - clock signal generated by master
- **Addressing**: 7-bit or 10-bit slave addressing scheme
- **Speed Modes**: Standard (100 kHz), Fast (400 kHz), Fast+ (1 MHz), High-speed (3.4 MHz)

### Project Implementation
[Customize this section based on your specific implementation]

**Master Device Configuration:**
- Microcontroller: [Specify your MCU - e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, STM32, etc.]
- Clock frequency: [Your chosen I2C speed]
- Pull-up resistors: [Value and placement - typically 4.7kΩ to 10kΩ]

**Communication Flow:**
1. Master initiates communication with START condition
2. Master sends slave address + R/W bit
3. Slave acknowledges (ACK) if address matches
4. Data transfer occurs (master → slave or slave → master)
5. Master terminates with STOP condition

**Data Frame Structure:**
```
START | SLAVE_ADDR (7-bit) | R/W | ACK | DATA (8-bit) | ACK | ... | STOP
```

## How to test

### Prerequisites
- [Your development board/microcontroller]
- [Programming environment - e.g., Arduino IDE, Platform IO, etc.]
- Logic analyzer or oscilloscope (recommended for debugging)
- Multimeter for voltage verification

### Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Connections:**
   ```
   Master Device    I2C Bus
   SDA pin    →     SDA line (with pull-up resistor)
   SCL pin    →     SCL line (with pull-up resistor)
   GND        →     Common ground
   VCC        →     Power supply (3.3V or 5V)
   ```

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Install required libraries: [list specific libraries]
   - Configure I2C pins in your code
   - Set appropriate clock frequency
   - Initialize I2C peripheral

3. **Basic Test Procedure:**

   **Test 1: I2C Bus Scan**
   ```
   Objective: Detect all connected I2C devices
   Expected Result: List of active slave addresses (0x[XX])
   ```

   **Test 2: Single Device Communication**
   ```
   Objective: Read/write data to specific slave device
   Steps:
   1. Send write command to slave address
   2. Verify ACK response
   3. Send read command
   4. Validate received data
   ```

   **Test 3: Multi-Device Communication**
   ```
   Objective: Communicate with multiple slaves sequentially
   Verification: Each device responds correctly to its address
   ```

### Testing Commands/Code Examples
[Add specific code snippets for your implementation]

```c
// Example initialization code
void i2c_init() {
    // Configure I2C pins
    // Set clock frequency
    // Enable I2C peripheral
}

// Example device scan
void i2c_scan() {
    for(uint8_t addr = 1; addr < 128; addr++) {
        // Send address and check for ACK
        if(i2c_check_device(addr)) {
            printf("Device found at 0x%02X\n", addr);
        }
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting
- **No ACK received**: Check connections, slave address, power supply
- **Clock stretching issues**: Verify slave device timing requirements
- **Data corruption**: Check pull-up resistor values, cable length, interference
- **Bus lockup**: Implement bus recovery procedure

### PCB Layout Considerations
- Keep SDA/SCL traces short and parallel
- Minimize capacitive loading
- Place pull-up resistors close to VCC
- Use ground plane for noise reduction
- Separate analog and digital grounds if applicable
